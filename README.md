# AudioFace

### What is AudioFace?
A mobile application that captures an image of yourself, analyzes your emotion/mood, and then adds a Spotify playlist to your Spotify account (for registered user only) that corresponds to that mood. Registered users have a additional functionality that allows them to friend other users - when you make a playlist using our application, each of those users will be notified of the action via email. Guest users have the ability to make playlists (although the playlists include a limited number of songs compared to registered users' accounts), but don't have the ability to make friends.
